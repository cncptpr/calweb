This is a tanstack start project.

You task is to build a TODO webinterface for a CardDav Server

The backend has will hold the credentials to the CardDav server.
Everyone using this app should see the same TODOs.
This meens fast syncing is very important.

For now, there is no login required.

It should be a simple, mainly mobile friendly UI.
Checking of tasks is most important, though creating and editing shoud be possible.

The UI should be a list of all TODOs, with checkboxes right there. Clicking on a task should redirect you.
Try to store as much state as possible in the url.

Work with a TODO list. Regularly run `npm run build` and fix all typescript errors.
These instuctions are written in agents.md.
